# LearnAI-examples 👨‍💻🧠

Welcome to **LearnAI-examples** — a practical learning repository designed to help experienced developers get into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on Generative AI, custom models, and language-based applications.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The goal of this project is to learn AI step-by-step through **hands-on exercises**, each focusing on a core concept:
- Understanding and using generative models
- Working with text embeddings
- Building document-aware chatbots
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Fine-tuning existing models
- Creating agents that can plan and execute tasks

---

## 🗂 Project Structure

Each exercise is placed in a separate folder with its own code, documentation, and `requirements.txt`.

| Exercise | Topic | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [`01-pdf-chatbot`](./01-pdf-chatbot) | Document Q&A | A chatbot that reads and answers questions based on PDF content using free local models |
| (Coming Soon) `02-rag-bot` | Full RAG Pipeline | A bot that performs retrieval + generation from external sources |
| (Coming Soon) `03-custom-agent` | AI Agent | An agent that plans and executes tasks based on instructions |

---

## ⚙️ General Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- No GPU required for the first exercises — models used are lightweight and free to run on CPU

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers)
- [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)
- Free and open-source models such as `google/flan-t5-xl`, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who is this for?

- Experienced developers (Python/Backend/Frontend)
- Engineers who want to get hands-on with AI and LLMs
- No prior ML experience required — all exercises start from scratch with explanations
